Welcome to my homepage! I am a final-year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am passionate about advancing efficient and resource-conserving machine learning systems for real-world applications. My research interests include bridging the gap between cutting-edge machine learning models and the system-level innovations needed to make them practical. 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Haoyu Dong at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), where I developed a benchmark dataset as well as a novel framework for open-structure table extraction tasks, later published at ICASSP'24. At the University of Washington, I collaborated with Prof. Baris Kasikci on the NanoFlow project, designing a forward-looking scheduler to optimize memory management in high-throughput LLM serving. Currently, I am working on an independent research project at UW, focusing on adaptive KV cache management for long-context LLMs, developing a novel approach to reduce memory usage without compromising performance. These experiences significantly enhanced my technical expertise and inspired my commitment to addressing system-level challenges in machine learning, shaping my vision for creating efficient and scalable frameworks in real-world applications.

I am seeking a PhD position for Fall 2025. Feel free to reach out to me at qinyu.quentin.xu@gmail.com. Iâ€™m always happy to connect!
